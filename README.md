## 🔧 Tech Stack

### ⚙️ Laravel Starter Kit
A pre-configured Laravel application that integrates frontend tools like Vite, Vue, Tailwind, and Inertia. It helps you quickly scaffold modern single-page applications (SPA) using Laravel and Vue.

### 🎨 Tailwind CSS
A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs with consistent styling directly in your markup.

### ⚡ Vite
A fast, modern frontend build tool that provides lightning-fast development and optimized production builds. It replaces Laravel Mix in modern stacks.

### 🧩 shadcn/vue
A component library of beautifully styled, accessible, and customizable Vue components inspired by the shadcn/ui library (originally built for React). Used for the sidebar, buttons, forms, etc.

### 🧭 Inertia.js
A library that lets you build modern single-page apps using classic server-side routing and controllers. It connects Laravel (backend) with Vue (frontend) without using an API.
